- Use npm to install a few dependencies
1. axios *(for importing APIs)*

5. mongoose
6. navigo *(this is for navigation using our nav bar)*
7. parcel

- In your package.json, within "scripts", make sure to put **(make sure a comma is separating them like listed)**:

2. "serve": "parcel index.html",
3. "app:watch": "nodemon --watch ./server -e js ./server/app.js",

- In your .env, make sure you have:
1. a mapbox api key
2. a openweathermap api key

4. a connection to Heroku or some other cloud-based that enables an ability to deploy and manage your site (This is used for a self-created API that checks out a few pizzas with their respective toppings)
